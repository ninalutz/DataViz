# DataViz
Just a collection of generic DataViz scripts
This repository is still being developed and cleaned, so please excuse the mess and sparcity

#Scripts
##Drawing_Lines
This is a simple script that generates a random network of nodes and draws edges between them. You can render and toggle different types of edges and change attributes like speed, looping time, and size of your network. 
This is skeleton code of a part of a visualization I wrote for my lab
